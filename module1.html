          1. Always work safety to prevent injuries. <br>
          2. Take care to prevent accidents to yourself.

          If you become injured on the job, this will not only affect you, but it will also have an effect on your
          family, coworkers, and company as well.
          <br>
          <span class="ppt-headings"> Factors of the accidents </span> <br>
          <span class="ppt-headings"> A. Accidents due to human factors </span> <br>
          Accidents caused by the improper use of a machine or tool, by wearing inappropriate clothes, or by the
          carelessness of the technician.
          <br>
          <span class="ppt-headings">B. Accidents due to physical factors </span> <br>
          Accidents caused by the malfunctioning of a machine or tool, the lack of integrity of a safety device, or a
          poor working environment.
          <br>
          Hint:
          Safety regulations may differ from country-to-country and may exceed the previous basic guidelines.

        <p>
          <span class="ppt-headings"> Work wear </span> <br>
          To prevent accidents, select workwear that is strong and fits well to facilitate work. Avoid work wear with
          exposed belts, buckles, and buttons, which can cause damage to vehicles while working.
          As a safety measure against injury or burns, avoid exposing the bare skin.
          <br>

          <span class="ppt-headings"> Work shoes </span> <br>
          Make sure to wear safety shoes while working. Because it is dangerous to wear sandals or sneakers that slip
          easily or reduce work efficiency. They also make the wearer vulnerable to injury due to accidentally dropped
          objects.
          <br>
          <span class="ppt-headings"> Work gloves</span> <br>
          When lifting heavy items or removing hot exhaust pipes or similar objects, it is advisable to wear gloves.
          However, it is not necessary to make a rule of wearing them for ordinary maintenance work.
          Whether you should wear gloves must be determined according to the type of work you will be performing.

          <span class="ppt-headings"> In the Workshop </span> <br>
          1. Always keep your workplace clean to protect yourself and others from injury.
          <br>
          2. Do not leave tools or parts on the floor where you or somebody else may trip over them. Make a habit of
          putting them on a workbench or workstand.
          Immediately clean up any spilled fuel, oil, or grease to prevent yourself or others from slipping on the
          floor.
          Do not assume an uncomfortable posture while working. It will not only affect your work efficiency, but it
          could cause you to fall and injure yourself.
          Be extremely careful when handling heavy objects because you could be injured if they are dropped on your
          feet. Also, remember that you could hurt your back if you try to lift an object that is too heavy for you.
          <br>
          3. To move from one area of the workplace to another, make sure to walk on a designated walkway.
          <br>
          4. Do not use combustables near switches, switchboards or electric motors etc. as they could easily spark
          creating a fire.

          <span class="ppt-headings"> In the Workshop </span> <br>
          When working with tools, observe the following precautions to prevent injury:
          <br>
          1. Electrical, hydraulic, and pneumatic equipment can cause serious injury if incorrectly used. <br>
          2. Wear protective goggles before using tools that scatter chips.
          Remove dust and chips from tools such as grinders and drills after use. <br>
          3. Do not wear gloves when operating a tool that rotates or when working in an area that has a rotational
          movement. Gloves can get caught in the rotating object and injure your hands. <br>
          4. To raise a vehicle on a lift, initially raise it until the tires are slightly off the ground. Then, make
          sure that the vehicle is securely supported on the lift before raising it entirely. Never attempt to shake the
          vehicle once it is raised, as this could cause the vehicle to fall and cause serious injury.

          </span> <br>
          The following precautions must be taken to prevent fires: <br>
          1. If the fire alarm sounds, all the employees should cooperate to extinguish the fire. To do this, they
          should
          know where the fire extinguishers are located and how to use them. <br>
          2. Do not smoke except in designated areas, and be sure to extinguish cigarettes in an ashtray.

          <span class="ppt-headings"> Fire prevention </span> <br>
          To prevent fires and accidents, take the following precautions in the vicinity of the flammable items: <br>
          1. Rags soaked with gasoline or oil may sometimes ignite by spontaneous combustion, so they should be disposed of
          in a metal container fitted with a cover. <br>
          2. Do not use an open flame in the vicinity of oil storage or flammable parts cleaning solvent. <br>
          3. Never use open flames or create sparks in the vicinity of batteries that are being charged, as they give off explosive gas that could ignite. <br>
          4. Do not bring fuel or cleaning solvents into the workshop except when necessary, and use special containers that can be sealed. <br>
          5. Do not dispose of combustible waste oils and gasoline into the sewer because they can cause a fire in the
          sewer system. <br>
          6. Always dispose of these materials in a drain tank or an appropriate container. <br>
          7. Do not start the engine of a vehicle with fuel leaks until the leaks have been repaired. 
          When making repairs
          on the fuel system, such as removing the carburetor, disconnect the negative (-) cable from the battery to
          prevent the engine from being accidentally started.

          Incorrect handling of electrical equipment can cause a short and a fire. Therefore, learn to use it correctly and carefully observe the following precautions: 
          <br>
          1. If any irregularity is detected in electrical equipment, immediately turn OFF the switch and contact the controller/foreman. 
          <br>
          2. In case of a short or accidental fire in an electrical circuit, turn OFF the switch first before taking fire extinguishing measures. 
          <br>
          3. Report any improperly routed wiring or improperly installed electrical equipment to the controller/foreman. 
          <br>
          4. Report any blown fuse to your supervisor because a blown fuse indicates some sort of electrical problem.

          <span class="ppt-headings"> Electrical Equipment Safety Precautions </span> <br>
          Never perform the following actions because they are extremely dangerous: 
          <br>
          1. Do not go near broken or dangling electrical wires. 
          <br>
          2. To prevent electrical shocks, never touch any electrical equipment with wet hands.
          <br>
          3. Never touch switches that are labeled "Out of Order". 
          <br>
          4. When disconnecting a plug, do not pull on the cord; pull on the plug itself. 
          <br>
          5. Do not route an electrical cord through wet or oil-soaked areas, through heated surfaces, or around sharp corners.
          <br>
          6. Do not use the combustibles near switches, switchboards or motors etc., which are easy to spark.

          <span class="ppt-headings"> Near Miss Activity </span> <br>
          In a near-miss activity, the technicians exchange the near-misses that they have experienced during the course of their everyday work. They describe to each other how the near-misses occurred in order to prevent others from encountering these close calls. They will then analyze the factors that lead to these dangerous situations and take appropriate measures to create a safer workplace. <br>
          If you encounter any of the situations given on the left, the following actions must be taken: <br>
          1. First, report the matter to the controller/foreman. 
          <br>
          2. Record what happened. <br>
          3. Have everyone seriously consider the matter. <br>
          4. Have everyone consider the countermeasures that should be taken. <br>
          5. Record all of the above and place the list in an area where everyone can see it.
